            This project offers a contemporary reading of a modernist apartment,
            in a sober, bright and controlled intervention.

          The accommodation has a distinctive shape with a rounded glass facade
          out against the park. The concrete walls are core insulated and can
          thus stand as they are. The idea was to create contrasted surfaces,
          either glazed or closed parties, to create balance and a more calm
          expression. Due to the large glass surfaces that reflect the
          surroundings, the residence melts nicely into the lush surroundings.

          A stone's throw from the Eiffel Tower, in a residence from the 1960s,
          this project is fully in line with the subjects that the agency likes:
          promoting the existing, dealing with its qualities as well as its
          constraints, and revealing the potential of a place sometimes
          forgotten. Located a stone's throw from the Eiffel Tower, in a
          residence from the 1960s, this project illustrates a type of
          intervention dear to the agency: working with what already exists,
          revealing its qualities, while dealing with the constructive
          constraints of the 'era. The apartment has undeniable advantages
          –large bay windows, mosaic balconies – but also a delicate
          configuration: great depth and mono-orientation which leave certain
          spaces in the shadows. The intervention aims to optimize natural light
          and the fluidity of circulation. The plan was largely opened and
          restructured. The newly created partitions are topped with transom
          claustras. These devices, present on all interior partitions, allow
          light to penetrate to the back of the apartment, while defining the
          different uses. The water and storage spaces are relegated to the
          second day, freeing up views and access to light for the living rooms.
          This spatial bias prioritizes functions while responding to the
          specificities of the place. A dialogue takes place between materials:
          anodized aluminum, chosen for its ability to reflect light diffusely,
          contrasts with the generous presence of wood, providing comfort and
          domesticity. Plays of textures highlight the architectural elements
          –bases, frames – without ever overloading the whole.
